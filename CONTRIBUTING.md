## I want to help work on _Digitize Text_ by reviewing issues and PRs

Thanks! We would really appreciate the help! Feel free to read our document on how to [respond to issues and PRs][responding to prs].
## Why did my issue/PR get closed?

It's not you, it's us! In order to effectively work through all the issues and give each the prompt attention it deserves, we need to keep a sharp focus on the work we have outstanding.

One way we do this is by closing issues that we don't feel are immediately actionable. This might mean that we need more information in order to investigate. Or, it might mean that we haven't been able to reproduce it using the provided info. In this case we might close the issue while we wait for others to reproduce the problem and possibly provide some more info that unlocks the mystery.
